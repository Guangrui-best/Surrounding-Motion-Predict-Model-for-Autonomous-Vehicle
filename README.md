## Introduction

- Predict surrounding agents motions of the autonomous vehicle over 5s given their historical 1s positions
- Useful for planning self driving vehicleâ€™s movement
- Deep learning techniques (CNN: Mixnet) + Ensemble Models
- Choose negative multi-log-likelihood as evaluate metric
- Full Information provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lyft-motion-prediction-autonomous-vehicles/overview/description)

## Run Model
- Follow the instruction on [Lyft Website](https://self-driving.lyft.com/level5/data/) to download Dataset
- Use Jupyter Notebooks under directory "notebook" to run our model
- Or run python script under "code", first changing your path to dataset
- Competition can be found on [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lyft-motion-prediction-autonomous-vehicles/overview/description)
